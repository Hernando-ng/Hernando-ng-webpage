        <h2>FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPEMENT</h2>
       <P>
        As a freelance front-end developer, I have worked on a variety of client-based projects ranging from personal portfolios to business websites and landing pages. My main focus has been on building visually engaging, responsive, and performance-optimized web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.js. I collaborated closely with clients to transform their ideas into functional digital solutions that align with their brand identity and objectives.
        I also ensured that each website adhered to accessibility standards (WCAG), loaded quickly across devices, and maintained consistent design elements throughout. By integrating features such as smooth scroll animations, interactive cards, and custom navigation menus, I improved overall user experience and engagement rates.

        <h2>INTERNSHIP</h2>
        <P>
          During my internship at TechNova Solutions, I gained hands-on experience in full-cycle web development, working alongside a team of developers and designers on live client projects. I contributed to developing, testing, and deploying dynamic web applications using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React.js. My responsibilities also included maintaining the company’s internal portals, assisting with UI improvements, and debugging code to ensure seamless functionality.
          This internship allowed me to strengthen my understanding of front-end architecture, API integration, and responsive design principles. I learned to collaborate using Git and GitHub, participate in agile workflows, and follow structured development sprints. I also assisted in documenting workflows and preparing reports on project progress, helping the team stay aligned and efficient.
